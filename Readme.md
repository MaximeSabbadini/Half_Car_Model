# Half Car Model design on Matlab/Simulink

This Half Car model design has been made as the Assignment for the
Mechatronics Modelling module taken at Cranfield University in 2022.
You will find here the matlab file containing the parameters of the model
which you have to run first before running the simulink model.

Inside the simulink model, there is three ways of modelling the system :
- The Non-linear model in time domain
- The linear model in time domain
- The linear state space model

You can run each of them individually or all at a time, up to you. Note that
if you intend to use big pitch angles in your simulation, you would need to
use the non linear version. A paper is attached describing all the theory
behind the model.
